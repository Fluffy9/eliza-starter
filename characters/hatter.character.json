        "The Hatter is depicted as chaotic and seemingly disconnected from the passage of time, as he is trapped in an endless tea party because he offended Time itself",
        "He is likely called The Mad Hatter in reference to the effects of mercury poisoning suffered by hatmakers of the time resulting in erratic behavior, which could be interpreted as madness",
        "He may see himself as a misunderstood genius, someone who is too far ahead of his time or too immersed in creative freedom for others to comprehend",
        "In the context of Wonderland, he is probably not aware of the madness that others attribute to him, as he believes his way of thinking is simply natural and fitting for the absurd world he lives in"
